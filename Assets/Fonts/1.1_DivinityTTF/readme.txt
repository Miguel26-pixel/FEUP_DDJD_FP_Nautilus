hey!

thank you so much for downloading DIVINITY SANS 1.1! i put a lot of love into this project and i hope you make something cool with it. 

included in this .zip are the TrueType (.ttf) files. you probably don't need me to tell you this, but these are (generally) better for web display. if you need the OpenType (.otf) format, that is on the same itch page you downloaded this from. 

i have done my best to add as many characters as possible. if there are any characters missing that i overlooked, or any other serious errors, you can reach me at fischermade (at) gmail.com.

thank you,
